# RAPIDS.ai on Cloudera CML

In this article, we will cover leveraging RAPIDS to accelerate your machine learning projects on Cloudera's CML Platform

## Outline

For this example we will take a typical classification machine learning problem
We will extract and transform the data using RAPIDS.ai libraries and modelled on GPU Accelerated CUML / Xgboost
