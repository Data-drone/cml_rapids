# RAPIDS.ai on Cloudera CML

In this article, we will cover leveraging RAPIDS to accelerate your machine learning projects on Cloudera's CML Platform

## Outline

For this example we will take a typical classification machine learning problem
We will extract and transform the data using RAPIDS.ai libraries and modelled on GPU Accelerated CUML / Xgboost

## TODOS

- get the data munging into an etl process to write out the files processed files and save on the VRAM
- can also explore porting to cudf
